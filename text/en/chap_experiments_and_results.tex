\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:Architecture}

In the \emph{generative model} approach to semi-supervised learning, one usually starts with a model that can be trained in the unsupervised manner (either an autoencoder or a generative adversarial network [CITE, CITE]) and then extends it to also perform the supervised task. For example, when starting with an autoencoder, one can use the encoder part as a dimensionality reduction mechanism and then build a supervised classification network that classifies the learned embeddings [CITE].

In our context of music recognition, we are highly motivated to build on top of the U-Net architecture [CITE] (figure \ref{fig:ArchitectureCombined}). It has first been used for biomedical image segmentation, however its superiority for object detection in music recognition has clearly been demonstrated by Pacha et al. [CITE].

The architecture can be viewed as a fully convolutional autoencoder with residual (skip) connections added between the encoder and decoder on every resolution level. The U-Net encoder is a typical fully-convolutional encoder that gradually reduces image dimensions, while increasing the channel count. Such an architecture is able to learn abstract representations of symbols present in the input image. The decoder then tries to go from these abstract representations back to specific ones, while at the same time modifying the reconstruction to fit the learned segmentation task. The core idea behind this architecture is that the decoder can utilize skip connections during upsampling, thereby producing a pixel-perfect segmentation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../img/architecture-complete.pdf}
    \caption{TODO}
    \label{fig:ArchitectureCombined}
\end{figure}

We choose to share the entire U-Net model for both the supervised and unsupervised tasks. The two tasks are differentiated only at the very last layer. The original U-Net architecture ends with a 1x1 convolution layer with sigmoid activation. It can be viewed as a pixelwise softmax for two output classes of a typical classification model. We decided to fork the architecture here, having one sigmoid convolution for the supervised segmentation task and one for the unsupervised reconstruction task.

The supervised task can be trained in almost the same way as the the original U-Net archtiecture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A batch $(x, y)$ of input images and expected segmentation masks is taken from the dataset.
    \item Input images $x$ are fed through the model, producing a prediction for the segmentation mask $\hat{y}$ and for the reconstructed image $\hat{x}$.
    \item A loss function is used, computing the distance between $y$ and $\hat{y}$ and generating gradients for the network.
    \item Reconstruction output $\hat{x}$ is ignored and no gradients for the branch are computed.
    \item An optimizer uses computed gradients to update model parameters.
\end{itemize}

The unsupervised task could be trained in the same way, using the other output branch of the model. This would work for a typical autoencoder, but since the U-Net architecture contains skip connections, the model could learn an identity function without using any of the abstraction-learning layers. The goal of unsupervised learning is learning these abstract features, so this training scheme is infeasible in our context.

We propose two ways of overcoming this challenge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item gated skip connections
    \item denoising
\end{itemize}

One option is to disable skip connections during reconstruction training and keep them enabled during segmentation training. This should force the model to learn abstract features during reconstruction, while also being able to utilize skip connections during segmentation. This scheme performs much better than a typical autoencoder without any skip connections, but is still outperformed by the next proposed scheme (see detailed comparison in section \ref{sec:SkipConnections}).

The second option is to add some noise to the input image during reconstruction training. The model would learn to not only reconstruct the input image, but also to remove the added noise. We took inspiration from denoising autoencoders [CITE AUTOENCODERS]. The difficult part is designing the noise function such that it would cause the model to learn abstract representaions (see section \ref{sec:NoiseGeneration}).

We consider the described scheme for unsupervised U-Net training to be the main contribution of this thesis. The proposed experiments try to assess the viability of the scheme in the context of semi-supervised learning.

Both the segmentation and reconstruction tasks are trained jointly on composite batches and a single composite loss function. A single optimizer step is used to update model parameters for both tasks somultaneously. The process is described in detail in section \ref{sec:Training}.

The last sigmoid layers output images with only one channel. For the reconstruction output, this data is interpreted as a grayscale image. For the segmentation output, it represents the probability the model assigns to each pixel of being in the target class. This means that the model can learn to segment only one symbol class.

Hajiƒç et al. [CITE] have explored the option of having multiple segmentation output channels. The hypothesis is that having the model learn multiple classes would improve its accuracy, since some internal representations can be shared. An added advantage is the reduced inference time as multiple segmentation masks can be infered in a single pass. Such a training however introduces problems related to unbalanced class distribution in the training data. Even if these can be overcome, their results suggest minimal accuracy benefits and a risk of decreasing accuracy in some cases.

Despite the fact that our experiment source code lets us easily train multiple classes, we choose not to explore this path as we are interested in the semi-supervised effects only.

\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../img/architecture-pieces.pdf}
    \caption{TODO}
    \label{fig:ArchitecturePieces}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:ArchitecturePieces} contains a recursive block diagram of our extended U-Net architecture. The model takes a single image as the input and produces both the segmentation mask and the reconstructed image. When training segmentation, the reconstructed image is ignored and when training reconstruction, the input image is covered in noise and the output segmentation is ignored.

Each level of the network begins and ends with a convolutional block (CB). It consists of two identical 3x3 convolutional layers with an optional dropout layer in between them. Both convolutional blocks on the same level output the same number of feature channels. The number of feature channels is dictated by a hyperparameter we call \emph{inner features}. If the network has 4 inner features, the zero-th level convolutions output 4 feature channels. Each successive level then has twice as many feature channels as the one above it (e.g. 4, 8, 16, 32). The figure \ref{fig:ArchitectureCombined} contains image dimensions and channel counts for each edge in the network. The image dimensions are taken with respect to an input image tile of size 512x256.

The downsampling block is implemented as a 2D max pooling layer [CITE]. The number of feature channels is preserved. If we track the feature count through the encoder, we always first double the number of channels in the convolutional block and then reduce the spatial dimensionality in half in the downsampling block. This way the model can learn to extract higher-level features, before the spatial resolution is lowered. Since the image is two dimensional, halving the resolution shrinks the number of pixels to one quarter. Combined with the doubling of channel count, one encoder level effectively discards half of the image data. This acts as a bottleneck, forcing the network to learn relevant high-level representations.

The upsampling block has to perform two operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item double the spatial dimensions
    \item halve the channel count
\end{itemize}

The resolution increase is performed by nearest neighbour interpolation (each pixel is copied to form a 2x2 region of the output image). The reduction in channel count is performed by a 1x1 convolutional layer, that can be trained to select or combine specific input channels. The output may also be padded by zeros, if the desired output resolution is not even (we need to exactly match the resolution of the skip connection).

The gate on the skip connection is implemented as a multiplication by one or zero. This also causes any back-propagating gradients to be zeroed out, when the gate is closed. We took inspiration for the gating implementation from LSTM and GRU cells used in recurrent neural networks [CITE, CIRE].

The output of the upsampling block and the skip connection is merged in an elementwise sum operation. The original U-Net paper uses concatenation [CITE], however Dorfer et al. have shown that using a sum instead speeds up training, while having minimal impact on model accuracy [CITE].

In all layers (except for the two output sigmoid layers) the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function is used. The reasons for this are described in section \ref{sec:ActivationFunction}.


\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:Datasets}

When performing experiments, we will use these three datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CVC-MUSCIMA [CITE]
    \item MUSCIMA++ [CITE]
    \item DeepScores v2 [CITE]
\end{itemize}

These are the only datasets in the OMR field that contain semantic segmentation labels (for Common Western Music Notation). A comprehensive list of available OMR datasets is maintained by Alexander Pacha on his GitHub page\footnote{\url{https://apacha.github.io/OMR-Datasets/}}.


\subsection{CVC-MUSCIMA}

This dataset was introduced in the article \emph{CVC-MUSCIMA: A ground truth of handwritten music score images for writer identification and staff removal} [CITE]. It contains 1000 pages of handwritten music, created by having 50 writers transcribe 20 unique music pages. It was designed for the tasks of staff removal and writer identification. It is also the only handwritten music dataset, consisting of entire music pages -- all other handwritten datasets contain only individual symbols. This makes it very important for research focusing on symbol detection.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../img/cvc-muscima.png}
    \caption{One page from the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset. Image taken from the website \url{http://www.cvc.uab.es/cvcmuscima/index_database.html}}
    \label{fig:CvcMuscima}
\end{figure}

Since the dataset does not contain segmentation labels, we will use it primarily as a source of unlabeled training data.


\subsection{MUSCIMA++}

MUSCIMA++ was created by Jan Hajiƒç jr. and Pavel Pecina as a general-purpouse OMR dataset. It was introduced in the article \emph{In Search of a Dataset for Handwritten Optical Music Recognition: Introducing MUSCIMA++} [CITE]. The dataset builds on top of the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset, providing rich annotations for 140 selected pages. The annotation scheme was designed to be sufficiently low-level for tasks such as object detection (bounding boxes, symbol classes, segmentation masks), while also having relationship data in the form of an oriented graph, that lets a user extract semantic information about the music. Dataset authors call this annotation scheme the \emph{Music Notation Graph} (MuNG).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{../img/muscima-pp.png}
    \caption{Annotations present in the MUSCIMA++ dataset (bounding boxes, segmentation masks and the notation graph). The image is taken from [CITE]}
    \label{fig:CvcMuscima}
\end{figure}

The dataset was updated in 2019, fixing bugs and modifying class names to be aligned with the SMuFL\footnote{\url{https://www.smufl.org/}} standard. A similar update was also performed on the DeepScores dataset [CITE], making it easier to use both datasets simultaneously. The latest dataset description and accompanying tools can be found on the GitHub page\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OMR-Research/muscima-pp}} of the OMR Research group\footnote{\url{https://omr-research.net/}}.

We will use this dataset as a source of labeled data for semantic segmentation.

\section{Semi-supervised Improvements}
\label{sec:SemisupervisedImprovements}

The main hypothesis this work is attempting to validate is that adding unlabelled data to the training process helps. We primarily want to improve model accuracy, but as we will see, this is not what our experiments suggest. They do, however, show improvements in other areas, such as training stability and reduced overfitting (section \ref{sec:UtilizingCvcMuscima}).

In the first experiment, we test how various labeled to unlabeled data ratios affect the training process. The experiment uses the MUSCIMA++ dataset [CITE]:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 10 pages act as the labeled set.
    \item 0, 5, 10 and 50 pages act as the unlabeled set.
    \item 10 pages act as the validation set.
    \item All of these pages come from the writer-independent train set of MUSCIMA++ and are chosen in a writer-independent manner (all the splits contain pages by different writers).
\end{itemize}

The learned task is notehead segmentation (both full and empty noteheads). Noteheads are an ideal symbol for this kind of measurement. Firstly, they are very abundant. Each page of the dataset contains many instances of them and they are evenly scattered over the whole page. If we were to instead detect more rare symbols (such as clefs or rests), it could skew the results, making it difficult to separate the effects we want to measure. Handwritten noteheads are also very diverse in style, making them more interesting to learn (compared to, say, stafflines).

All model hyperparameters are set to sensible deafults. The derivation of these values is desribed later in section \ref{sec:UnderstandingHyperparameters}. The model capacity, described by the \emph{inner features} parameter is set to 8, which is useful to know for comparison with the next experiment. The proposed dataset is rather small and so the training is very noisy (figure \ref{fig:ExplorationNoteheadsNoDropout}). To stabilize the trainig we set the dropout parameter to 50\% [CITE DROPOUT].

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/01-exploration-noteheads/noteheads.pdf}
    \caption{Training on a small dataset without dropout is noisy, see the orange line at the beginning and the green line at the end.}
    \label{fig:ExplorationNoteheadsNoDropout}
\end{figure}

We expect that as we add more and more unlabeled data, the F1 score should reach higher and higher. Or at least not get worse. This is not what we see in the figure \ref{fig:ExplorationNoteheads}. The fully supervised model outperforms all the others by a clear margin.

Focusing only on the semi-supervised models, it seems that adding more unsupervised data maybe helps here, although the three lines end up on top of each other at the epoch 200. A better idea is to look at the figure \ref{fig:ExplorationNoteheadsEvaluation}. The chart contains evaluation results on the test set of six runs of each configuration. We can clearly see how the performance rises with more unsupervised data. Unfortunately it does not reach above the fully-supervised results. We unfortunately cannot push the amount of unlabeled data much higher, as it would break our training process (see section \ref{sec:BatchSize}) and it would likely also have diminishing returns. The actual numbers are summarized in table \ref{tab:ExplorationNoteheads}.

The reason for the drop in performance is actually caused by the fact, that the supervised model has to only learn one task -- segmentation. Whereas the semi-supervised one has to also learn the unsupervised reconstruction task. This claim is explored in the next section and is supported by the fact that the performance drop disappears when we increase model capacity.

\section{Utilizing CVC-MUSCIMA}
\label{sec:UtilizingCvcMuscima}

This experiment attempts to address issues of the previous experiment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item fixed model capacity
    \item small dataset
\end{itemize}

In the chapter \ref{chap:CurrentStateOfOMR} we described the two major datasets for handwritten music recognition: CVC-MUSCIMA [CITE] and MUSCIMA++ [CITE]. The dataset MUSCIMA++ is a highly annotated subset of CVC-MUSCIMA. We can view both datasets together as a single semi-supervised dataset, being 12\% labeled and 88\% unlabeled. To the best of our knowledge, nobody has yet tried to utilize both datasets simulatenously for semantic segmentation.

Hajiƒç jr. and Dorfer [CITE 1, 2] have used the U-Net architecture [CITE] for segmentation and they trained it on the MUSCIMA++ dataset. Their results are very impressive. Being able to further build on their work and improving the model by utilizing unlabeled data from CVC-MUSCIMA would be very helpful for the field of OMR. This experiment attempts to do just that.

We take the whole CVC-MUSCIMA dataset, separate writers from the MUSCIMA++ independent test set, separate 20 pages for validation set and remove other pages from these validation writers. The pages that remain are produced by writers not present in both the test set and the validation set. These remaining pages are partially contained in the MUSCIMA++ dataset (99 pages) and all the other pages are used as unlabeled data (551 pages). Therefore we train on 650 out of 1000 pages of the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset.

Since the dataset is now much larger than in the previous experiment (section \ref{sec:SemisupervisedImprovements}), we no longer need the dropout. In fact, the training is even more stable and individual runs are clearly separated.

This experiment attempts to compare fully-supervised and semi-supervised models, regardless of their capacity. We therefore train various model capacities (the \emph{inner features} model parameter) and then compare the best ones for each setting.

Another difference to the previous experiment is that the ratio of labeled to unlabeled data is fixed and given by dataset sizes. The ratio of 99 to 551 pages corresponds best with the ratio 10:50.

\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/01-exploration-noteheads/noteheads-dropout.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/01-exploration-noteheads/noteheads-dropout-smooth.pdf}
    \caption{Lorem ipsum dolor. TODO: the two improvements charts}
    \label{fig:CvcImprovements}
\end{figure}

The validation dataset F1 score over the course of training can be seen in figure \ref{fig:CvcImprovements}. In these charts we can see:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Models with 1 and 2 \emph{inner features} are clearly underfitting in the supervised mode (compared to other models). When we add the unlabeled data, their perfomance drops significantly, but the training curve gets much smoother.
    \item Models with 4 and 8 \emph{inner features} worsen much less and also get smoother (especially 4 becomes much more stable).
    \item Model 16 no longer worsens, it is able to learn both tasks.
\end{itemize}

Conclusions can be drawn from these observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The reconstruction and segmentation tasks clearly compete for model capacity. The performance drop of adding unlabeled data decreases, as the model capacity increases.
    \item The addition of unlabeled data can be used as a regularization technique. This is evident from the fact that training curves get much smoother as we add unlabeled data. A~regularization effect is also described in the corresponding literature [CITE SSL overview].
    \item All models come close to the 96\% line, but never cross it. While the semi-supervised models get as good as the fully-supervised, they never get better. It seems the reconstruction task is not learning any useful representations. [TODO: expand on this further and show reconstruction visualizations - they learn simple shapes, not abstract objects]
\end{itemize}

% TODO: evaluate best models of SUP and SEMISUP, maybe they differ in test score? Probbably not.


\section{Knowledge Transfer}
\label{sec:KnowledgeTransfer}

TODO: knowledge transfer experiment


\section{Understanding Hyperparameters}
\label{sec:UnderstandingHyperparameters}


\subsection{Batch Size}
\label{sec:BatchSize}

In the deep learning field, it is known that having a small batch size makes the training fast and noisy, whereas a large batch size makes it more stable at the cost of being slower [CITE DL BOOK]. Since our model is fully cconvolutional and we train it on image tiles of fixed size, we can consider the size of these tiles to be a parameter similar to batch size. It also regulates the amount of data used for gradient estimation. If the tiles are large enough, we can get away with batch size of 1 (this is what the original U-Net article does [CITE]).

Using such a small batch size is, however, not possible in our case. Our training process expects batches containing both labeled and unlabeled data. Batch size determines the total number of these two kinds of data items in the single composite batch. The ratio of these two item types within the composite batch is dictated by the ratio within the whole dataset. So if our dataset has, for example, 1:5 labeled to unlabeled data, the batch size has to be at least 6. Otherwise we will start getting batches that contain only unlabeled data. This rule isn't as strict, since the model would probably learn both tasks even if half of all batches were missing labeled data, however if the imbalance becomes too severe, the training fails.

TODO: figure with the failing training (bs=2,ratio=1:10)

An example of such a failing training can be seen in figure TODO???. The model learns to perform reconstruction even for the segmentation task. This is understandable, since the two tasks are differentiated only at the last layer (1x1 sigmoid convolution). If all second-to-last layer activations contain image reconstruction data, then any 1x1 convolution combination of them will do as well.

Since all of our experiments have training data ratios between 1:0 and 1:10, we chose to set the batch size parameter to 10.


\subsection{Dropout}
\label{sec:Dropout}

We introduced dropout [CITE] when training on small datasets (section \ref{sec:SemisupervisedImprovements}). The training was so noisy, that it was difficult to infer any measurable differences between runs. Therefore we used dropout as a mean to stabilize the training. The model performace also sligtly increased in this setting.

When we train on larger datasets, the training is no longer unstable and dropout is not needed (section \ref{sec:UtilizingCvcMuscima}). In fact, it causes the training process to converge much slower (2x or more) and it does not perform any better.

Both the original U-Net article [CITE] and the article by Hajiƒç jr. et al. [CITE] use the U-Net architecture without any dropout. In fact, an article by Thompson et al. [CITE] argues, that using traditional dropout on convolutional layers may not be ideal. This agrees with our findings, that dropout helps only in very specific circumstances.

It may be the case, that using batch normalization instead or dropout (like Hajiƒç jr. et al. [CITE]) has the same effect of regularizing the network. However our goal is not to find the optimal architecture, but to measure the impact of unsupervised data. For that reason we did not explore this option.

From all this we conclude that dropout should be disabled by default.


\subsection{Skip Connections}
\label{sec:SkipConnections}

% chart of the three
% gated works better than none, and solid are better still
% however we are still below fully-supervised, maybe being over would change the order! Disclaim that!


\subsection{Unsupervised Loss Weight}

% changes relative learning speed ofthe two tasks, but they get learned nonetheless
% (we say we want segmentation - then reconstruction is also learned, just very slowly)
% + charts show minimal difference when tweaking the value
% when set to 0, fully-supervised mode is entered


\subsection{Noise Parameters}
\label{sec:NoiseParameters}

% noise dropout - for solid connection has little effect -> model learns sup easily
% for gated connection we see an improvement -> model is forced to learn representations
% that actually help it?


\subsection{Activation Function}
\label{sec:ActivationFunction}

We first used ReLU activation function (rectified linear unit) [CITE] in all convolutional layers (except the final sigmoid layer), just like it is used in the original U-Net article [CITE]. However, we occasionally encountered problems with convergence. Replacing the activation function with ELU (exponential linear unit) [CITE] solved these issues. We took inspiration from Hajiƒç jr. et al. [CITE], who also use the ELU activation function. The difference between the two can be seen in figure \ref{fig:ActivationFunctions}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/03-activation-function/functions.pdf}
    \caption{Visualization of the explored activation functions. ReLU is flat in negative values and therefore has no gradient there. ELU has exponentially decaying gradient and leaky ReLU has a constant gradient. The parameter for the displayed leaky ReLU is 0.1 to make its shape more apparent.}
    \label{fig:ActivationFunctions}
\end{figure}

The convergence problems were happening at the very beginning of training. The model quickly learned to output a completely black image and never recovered from that state. We think it was an instance of the "dying ReLU" problem [CITE]. When the model is first initialized, it outputs a gray-ish image, since model weights are drawn from a uniform distribution centered on zero and the final sigmoid layer turns that into a 0.5 gray. Because the target images have black background, the model first learns to produce mostly black images. Only then does it learn to output white pixels as well (see figure \ref{fig:ActivationTrainingProgression}). With ReLU, the first training phase probably overshoots into the negative range of most synapses and that causes the model to get stuck in that negative range with zero gradient.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/03-activation-function/progression.pdf}
    \caption{The training process starts by learning to output a mostly black image, which probably causes the model to overshoot during the fully-supervised training and get stuck in the "dying ReLU" problem.}
    \label{fig:ActivationTrainingProgression}
\end{figure}

Interestingly enough, this problem happens only when training in the fully-supervised mode. We have never encountered it, when training in the semi-supervised mode. This again suggests that the unlabeled data acts as regularization, damping any extreme gradients, and stabilizing the training.

We also tried using the leaky ReLU function [CITE] with parameter $\alpha = 0.01$, however the problem still remained. Maybe a larger value for $\alpha$ would help, although we already knew that ELU works, so we haven't explored this further.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm]{../../figures/03-activation-function/performance.pdf}
    \caption{An experiment from section \ref{sec:UtilizingCvcMuscima} with 8 inner features, trained in fully-supervised mode with various activation functions. All runs show the same performance.}
    \label{fig:ActivationFunctionPerformances}
\end{figure}

We run one of the experiments from section \ref{sec:UtilizingCvcMuscima} with all proposed activation functions to see what impact it has on model performance (figure \ref{fig:ActivationFunctionPerformances}). We can clearly see that they all perform equally well, so we choose ELU as the only activation function that does not suffer from the convergence problem. We thereby validate the work of Dorfer. et al. [CITE] (their article does not provide explanation for the use of ELU, but we belive they must have encountered these exact same problems).
