% - very minor improvements and mostly not in the perfomance, not worth the effor
% - check notes in the thesis-text-structure.md
% - main acomplishment -- ways of training U-Net in an unsupervised manner



% - the improvement is minor and difficult to achieve
% - unsup data does provide regularization
%     - less noisy learning curve
%     - SS coverges, when fully supervised does not
%     - prevents overfitting (expand on what that means)
% From introduction:
% - we found that improvements can be achieved, however they are relatively minor and occur in only very specific circumstances
%     - this is probably because the model learns only low-level features (as seen in denoising visualizations); should it learn higher-level featuers, it could work better (GAN, etc..)
%         - show visualizations, desribe in detail
%         - describe GAN as a learned-loss function
